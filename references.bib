  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Students' idealism and desire to work with underserved
               populations decline as they progress from preclinical training
               through clerkships and residency. With an increasingly diverse
               population and increasing health disparities, academic health
               centers need to incorporate changes in their curricula to train
               socially responsible and idealistic physicians. International
               electives can provide valuable learning experiences to help
               achieve these goals. METHODS: Sixty-six preclinical medical
               students at the University of Texas Medical Branch participated
               in an international elective from 1997 to 2005. After 1 week of
               didactics, they spent 3 weeks as part of a multidisciplinary
               medical team in rural Nicaragua. Postelective questionnaires
               were administered. From students' responses, we identified
               common learning themes and grouped them under the categories of
               attitudes, awareness, and skills. Limitations included a
               self-selection bias, lack of a control group, and limited
               follow-up. RESULTS: After the elective, students had an
               increased interest in volunteerism, humanitarian efforts, and
               working with underserved populations both in the United States
               and abroad, as well as more compassion toward the underserved.
               Students also reported a heightened awareness of social
               determinants of health and public health, and a broadened global
               perspective, as well as increased self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS:
               Our findings illustrate that a well-structured, mentored
               experience in international health can have a positive impact on
               preclinical students' attitudes, including their compassion,
               volunteerism, and interest in serving under-served populations,

  author    = "Tylor, Edward Burnett",
  abstract  = "Edward Burnett Tylor (1832--1917) was an English anthropologist
               who is widely considered the founder of anthropology as a
               scientific discipline. He was the first Professor of
               Anthropology at the University of Oxford from 1896 to 1909, and
               developed a broad definition of culture which is still used by
               scholars. First published in 1871, this classic work explains
               Tylor's idea of cultural evolution in relation to anthropology,
               a social theory which states that human cultures invariably
               change over time to become more complex. Unlike his
               contemporaries, Tylor did not link biological evolution to
               cultural evolution, asserting that all human minds are the same
               irrespective of a society's state of evolution. His book was
               extremely influential in popularising the study of anthropology
               and establishing cultural evolution as the main theoretical
               framework followed by anthropologists in the nineteenth and
               early twentieth centuries. Volume 2 contains Tylor's
               interpretation of animism in society.",

@BOOK{Davies2011,
  title     = "Paganism: A Very Short Introduction",
  author    = "Davies, Owen",
  abstract  = "'Paganism' is an evocative word that, even today, conjures up
               deep-seated emotions and prejudices. Until recently, it was
               primarily a derogatory term used by Christians to describe the
               non-Christian cultures confronted and vanquished by their
               Churches. For some it evokes images of sacrifice and barbaric
               behaviour, while for others it symbolises a peace-loving,
               nature-worshipping spiritual relationship with the earth. This
               Very Short Introduction explores the meaning of paganism -
               through a chronological overview of the attitudes towards its
               practices and beliefs - from the ancient world through to the
               present day. Owen Davies largely looks at paganism through the
               eyes of the Christian world, and how, over the centuries,
               notions and representations of its nature were shaped by
               religious conflict, power struggles, colonialism, and
               scholarship. Despite the expansion of Christianity and Islam,
               Pagan cultures continue to exist around the world, whilst in the
               West new formations of paganism constitute one of the
               fastest-growing religions. Focussing on paganism in Europe, but
               exploring the nature of paganism globally, Davies looks at how
               Europeans discovered new cultures through colonial expansion,
               missionary work, and anthropological study. Contemporary social
               paganism can be a liberating and social force, and the idea of a
               global Pagan theology is now on the religious map. ABOUT THE

  abstract  = "Abstract This essay is Thomas Nagel's classic ``What Is It Like
               to Be a Bat?,'' which was influential in drawing attention to
               consciousness as a central problem for philosophy, psychology,
               and neuroscience. It also influenced the recognition of the
               consciousness of non-human creatures as an important subject of
               study. The essay argues that the essential subjectivity of
               conscious experience---what it is like for the creature
               undergoing it---means that reductionist theories of mind, which
               try to analyze it in physical terms, cannot succeed. It follows
               that the physical sciences cannot provide a complete description
               of reality, and that the physical conception of objective
               reality must be transcended if science is going to comprehend
               the mind.",

  abstract  = "Graeco-Roman religion in its classic form was polytheistic; on
               the other hand, monotheistic ideas enjoyed wide currency in
               ancient philosophy. This contradiction provides a challenge for
               our understanding of ancient pagan religion. Certain forms of
               cult activity, including acclamations of 'one god' and the
               worship of theos hypsistos, the highest god, have sometimes been
               interpreted as evidence for pagan monotheism. This book
               discusses pagan monotheism in its philosophical and intellectual
               context, traces the evolution of new religious ideas in the time
               of the Roman empire, and evaluates the usefulness of the term
               'monotheism' as a way of understanding these developments in
               later antiquity outside the context of Judaism and Christianity.
               In doing so, it establishes a framework for understanding the
               relationship between polytheistic and monotheistic religious
               cultures between the first and fourth centuries AD.",
